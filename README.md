# FinalProject

The purpose of the application will be to provide a way to color and draw without having art supplies. The outline drawing willÂ be more complex to be more of a challenge for teens and adults. The images can be more simple to be suitable for children as well but since there will be a lot of tools which they may not understand how to use, it would not be best suited for kids.

The application will allow the user to select a picture to color in (which will draw an outlined image to the canvas) and then the user can use the various tools that will be provided to color the drawing in and create/add to the background. There will also be a blank option so the user can create their own drawing.

Some of the tools will be line, gradient, shapes, fill bucket, save and undo. The tool selection panel will likely use a form selection system to pick things like color, brush thickness and opacity and use Ajax to update this section of the form without changing the canvas. The application will be unique because it will have more tool options than just fill (as most online coloring apps have) since the user can have shapes, gradients, and various other tools to make the application more full-featured than current coloring book applications.
